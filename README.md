# Derived fields in yt for RAMSES-RTZ

Make derived fields in yt for simulations run with the RAMSES-RTZ code. Specifically, the MEGATRON Simulation.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AnatoleStorck/yt_derived_fields.git
   ```

2. Install yt:
   Warning: A specific version of yt is required, which may have not made it to the current main branch yet. Ask Anatole Storck for the version of yt that is compatible with this repository.

   ```shell
   conda install -c conda-forge yt
   ```

3. (Optional) Generate atomic data:
    The emission line module requires atomic data generated by the chianti package. Once a chianti database is generated, you can use the `generate_atomic_data.py` script to generate the atomic data for the emission line module.

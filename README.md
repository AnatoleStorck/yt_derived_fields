# Derived fields in yt for RAMSES-RTZ

Make derived fields in yt for simulations run with the RAMSES-RTZ code. Specifically, the MEGATRON Simulation.

## How to use


1. Install yt:
   Warning: A specific version of yt is required, which may have not made it to the current main branch yet. Ask Anatole Storck for the version of yt that is compatible with this repository.

   ```shell
   conda install -c conda-forge yt
   ```

2. Install the repository and copy TOML specific to MEGATRON for global yt configuration:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AnatoleStorck/yt_derived_fields.git
   cd yt_derived_fields
   pip install -e .
   ```

   ```shell
   cp yt_derived_fields/megatron_derived_fields/yt.toml ~/.config/yt/.
   ```

3. Use the derived field functions:
   Generate new fields to be used with various yt functions. Chemistry fields include the electron number density, mean molecular weight, molecular hydrogen number density, and others. Cooling includes two H2 cooling fields, full metal cooling, and others. Star derived fields include a proper way to derive the star particle ages.

   ```python
   import yt
   
   import yt_derived_fields.megatron_derived_fields.chemistry_derived_fields as chem_fields
   import yt_derived_fields.megatron_derived_fields.cooling_derived_fields as cool_fields
   import yt_derived_fields.megatron_derived_fields.stars_derived_fields as star_fields

   ds = yt.load(<path_to_your_favorite_megatron_output>)

   chem_fields.create_chemistry_derived_fields(ds)
   cool_fields.create_cooling_derived_fields(ds)
   star_fields.create_stars_derived_fields(ds)
   ```

4.  Generate atomic data for observational derived fields:
    The emission line module requires atomic data generated by the chianti package. Once a chianti database is generated (https://www.chiantidatabase.org/chianti_download.html), you can use the `spectral_utils/generate_atomic_data.py` script to generate the atomic data for the emission line module (make sure to replace the path at the top of the file to the database). Then you can use the emission line module as follows.

   ```python
   import yt
   
   import yt_derived_fields.megatron_derived_fields.emission_derived_fields as emission_fields

   ds = yt.load(<path_to_your_favorite_megatron_output>)

   coll_lines = ["O3-5007", "S2-6731"]
   rec_lines = ["Lya", "Hb", "He-1640"]

   emission_fields.get_emission_lines(ds, coll_lines=coll_lines, rec_lines=rec_lines)
   ```

5. More observational derived fields for continuum spectra (nebular and stellar):
   The nebular and stellar continuum modules require data to compute the spectra. On glamdring, these can be found in `/mnt/glacier/DATA/`.
